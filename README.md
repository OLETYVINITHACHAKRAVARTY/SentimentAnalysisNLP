Sentiment Analysis System Using NLP and Python
Overview
This project is a comprehensive Sentiment Analysis System developed using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system analyzes text data to classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral, providing insights into public opinion and emotional tone in textual content.

Features
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization for cleaner input data.
Feature Extraction: Utilized techniques such as TF-IDF and word embeddings to represent text numerically.
Machine Learning Models: Implemented and compared various algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes for sentiment classification.
Performance Metrics: Evaluated the model using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to ensure reliability.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
Scikit-learn for model building
NLTK and SpaCy for NLP tasks
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
How It Works
Data Input: Text data (e.g., product reviews, tweets, etc.) is provided for analysis.
Preprocessing: The system cleans and prepares text for analysis.
Model Training: Sentiment classification models are trained on labeled datasets.
Prediction: The system predicts sentiment for new input text based on the trained model.
Use Cases
Analyzing customer feedback and reviews
Monitoring brand sentiment on social media
Identifying trends in public opinion
